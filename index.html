      <li>Botany is the branch of biology that deals with plants.
      <li> It involves the study of the structure and properties of
        plant life, including flowers and trees.
      <li> Also included are plant classification and the study of the interactions
        of plants with their physical environment.
      <li>Flower biology acquaints us with many common characteristics of
        flowers, such as where they are grown, seasonality, blooming characteristics, fragrances and personality, as
        well
        as any nutritional and medicinal values they might offer.

      <li> The stigma is the sticky knob at the top of the
        pistil.
      <li>It is attached to the long, tubelike structure called the style.
      <li> The style leads to the ovary that contains the female egg cells called ovules.
