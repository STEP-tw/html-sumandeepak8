      <li>Botany is the branch of biology that deals with plants.
      <li> It involves the study of the structure and properties of
        plant life, including flowers and trees.
      <li> Also included are plant classification and the study of the interactions
        of plants with their physical environment.
      <li>Flower biology acquaints us with many common characteristics of
        flowers, such as where they are grown, seasonality, <br> blooming characteristics, fragrances and personality,
        as
        well as any nutritional and medicinal values they might offer.

  <p>
    <ul>
      <br><br><br><br>
      <li>Flowers have some basic parts.
      <li>The female part is the pistil.
      <li>The pistil usually is located in the center of the
        flower and is made up of three parts: the stigma, style, and ovary.
      <li> The stigma is the sticky knob at the top of the
        pistil.
      <li>It is attached to the long, tubelike structure called the style.
      <li> The style leads to the ovary that contains the female egg cells called ovules.
