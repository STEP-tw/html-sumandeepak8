    <p class="blueFont"><b>Botany can be considered a subset of biology that specifically focuses on plants. Thus,
        botanists (plant
        biologists) may study a wide range of topics within the plant world. On the whole, botanists study an estimated
        400,000 species of living plant organisms.
