      <p style="color: green;font-size: 20px"><b>Botany can be considered a subset of biology that specifically focuses on plants. Thus, botanists (plant
    biologists) may study a wide range of topics within the plant world. On the whole, botanists study an estimated
    400,000 species of living plant organisms.
