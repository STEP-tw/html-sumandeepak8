        <li>Flowers have some basic parts.
        <li>The female part is the pistil.
        <li>The pistil usually is located in the center of the
          flower and is made up of three parts: the stigma, style, and ovary.
        <li> The stigma is the sticky knob at the top of the
          pistil.
        <li>It is attached to the long, tubelike structure called the style.
        <li> The style leads to the ovary that contains the female egg cells called ovules.
